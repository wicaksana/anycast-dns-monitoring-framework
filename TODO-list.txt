To-do list:
- main page should use latest measurement result (https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v1/measurement-latest/<measurement-id>/)
- REST requirements (from front-end):
    - get measurements for a certain period

- REST requirements (to access other providers):
    RIPE atlas:
    - get measurement data
    - get probe data

- add one page for IPv6
- put ip prefix -> ASN map into database
- validate your result

Target:
- connect control-plane backend to frontend

--------------------
2016-05-09
- IPv6 measurement feature

2016-05-06
- finish ris.py
Remarks:
- previously, my idea was to attach probes into ASN nodes in the tree visualization. While it is correct for data-plane,
  doing so for control-plane is misleading. Firstly, control-plane data is taken from route collector.
- is it possible to compare two different data-plane data when most of the time traceroute data is incomplete? Of course
  I can say the path experienced by a certain probe changes, but I can't say that the path is shorter or longer.
- how is it possible to create data-plane tree that contains few nodes in its 1st level?
- where can I get time-based looking glass data? RIS only provides recent data only
- where can I get static IPv6 ASN list?

2016-05-05
- mongodb is up and running
- refactor the code
- data for data-plane is available
- datetimepicker is restricted to today

2016-05-02
- connect front-end with back-end
- start working with dynamic data

2016-05-01
- add Flask

2016-04-30
- add zoom and pan features to the tree graph

2016-04-28
- comparison feature is now working properly (although the CSS needs to be refined)
