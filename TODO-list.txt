To-do list:
- add logging capabilities
- validate your result
- select representative probes for data-plane measurements (/api/v1/measurement/1000192/result/?start=1356994800&stop=1357081200&prb_id=270,579)
    - Should select probes located near to RIS route collectors
--------------------
2016-05-23
- selecting probes close to route collectors
    - RIPE Atlas only provides coordinates, not the address. Need to map GPS coord. into its address. I use geopy.
    - create the list of countries where RRs reside. I put all probes in that countries into my db.
    - todo: get the address of those probes using geopy later!
        - done partially
    - todo: switch back to python3! use pybgpstream directly from github


2016-05-13
- fix populate_db.py
- fix problem caused by 'aggregation' text in RIS data (see method _get_latest_data() from ris.py)

  Remarks:
  - why BGP community is crucial, so that it is included in RIS data?

2016-05-12
- finish connecting backend to frontend. Data is plotted fine. The only thing is, it takes so long to load data using
  BGPStream.

 Remarks:
    - Now, focus on analyzing the (potential) difference between IPv4 and IPv6 catchment areas:
    - the idea: is there any difference between catchment areas of IPv4 and IPv6 DNS services? If there is (I hope so),
      what would be the cause? Can this tool detect that? Is there any difference between control and data-plane?
    - use built-in measurement. Start from root servers with small numbers of instances first. Let say, C.
    - Start familiarize and working with CHAOS
    - can I create geographical visualization based on this?
    - don't forget to update probe data in db

- about the tool in general:
    Back-end:
    - change it to use built-in measurement against a certain root server, instead of just using random measurement ID

    Visualization:
    - finish working on statistics widgets
    - use better template
    - TODO: there is possibility that measurement data retrieved from RIS is empty. Add a handler for this condition in
            database helper (db.py), especially in bulk write method, because it generates exception for empty data
    - hovering an AS node should provide information about the respective ASN (the organization, description, etc.)

2016-05-11
- incorporating BGPStream into ris.py for historical control-plane data

2016-05-10
- updating front-end?

2016-05-09
- IPv6 measurement feature is finished
- use IPv6 data from Cymru. In the future, migrate IPv4 to use Cymru as well
- TODO: check validity of tree data for IPv6 data-plane

2016-05-06
- finish ris.py
Remarks:
- previously, my idea was to attach probes into ASN nodes in the tree visualization. While it is correct for data-plane,
  doing so for control-plane is misleading. Firstly, control-plane data is taken from route collector.
- is it possible to compare two different data-plane data when most of the time traceroute data is incomplete? Of course
  I can say the path experienced by a certain probe changes, but I can't say that the path is shorter or longer.
- how is it possible to create data-plane tree that contains few nodes in its 1st level?
- where can I get time-based looking glass data? RIS only provides recent data only --> install pybgpstream
- where can I get static IPv6 ASN list? --> just use Cymru

2016-05-05
- mongodb is up and running
- refactor the code
- data for data-plane is available
- datetimepicker is restricted to today

2016-05-02
- connect front-end with back-end
- start working with dynamic data

2016-05-01
- add Flask

2016-04-30
- add zoom and pan features to the tree graph

2016-04-28
- comparison feature is now working properly (although the CSS needs to be refined)
