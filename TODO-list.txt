To-do list:
- validate your result

Target:
- connect control-plane backend to frontend

--------------------
2016-05-11
- incorporating BGPStream into ris.py for historical control-plane data

2016-05-10
- updating front-end?

2016-05-09
- IPv6 measurement feature is finished
- use IPv6 data from Cymru. In the future, migrate IPv4 to use Cymru as well
- TODO: check validity of tree data for IPv6 data-plane

2016-05-06
- finish ris.py
Remarks:
- previously, my idea was to attach probes into ASN nodes in the tree visualization. While it is correct for data-plane,
  doing so for control-plane is misleading. Firstly, control-plane data is taken from route collector.
- is it possible to compare two different data-plane data when most of the time traceroute data is incomplete? Of course
  I can say the path experienced by a certain probe changes, but I can't say that the path is shorter or longer.
- how is it possible to create data-plane tree that contains few nodes in its 1st level?
- where can I get time-based looking glass data? RIS only provides recent data only --> install pybgpstream
- where can I get static IPv6 ASN list? --> just use Cymru

2016-05-05
- mongodb is up and running
- refactor the code
- data for data-plane is available
- datetimepicker is restricted to today

2016-05-02
- connect front-end with back-end
- start working with dynamic data

2016-05-01
- add Flask

2016-04-30
- add zoom and pan features to the tree graph

2016-04-28
- comparison feature is now working properly (although the CSS needs to be refined)
