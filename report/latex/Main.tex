\textbf{Abstract}
	\end{center}
	Anycast has been extensively used by DNS Root Server operators to improve performance, resilience, and reliability. In line with the migration towards IPv6 networks, 9 out of 11 anycasted Root Servers are running on both IPv4 and IPv6 (dual-stack mode) today. Ideally, both protocols should provide similar performances. Problem arises since operators may have different peering policies for IPv4 and IPv6 networks, which leads to different catchment areas for the same service and potentially different quality of service. In this thesis, we analyze the IPv4 and IPv6 catchments of anycasted Root Servers from control-plane perspective between February 2008 to June 2016 using BGP data from RIPE RIS. We study the evolution and  the differences of the catchment areas over the time. We also develop visualization tool to help operator assess their catchment areas. While we specifically study DNS Root Server, our methodology can be applied to other anycast services as well.
	
	%We find that most Root Servers have relatively high convergence level (50\% to 80\%), except for J- and M-Root. Over the time, the level is increasing in general. Some experience sharp increase, some relatively stagnated, and few experiences temporary decrease. The Root Servers also have different visibility levels, which is influenced by the peering policies rather than the number of instances.

\label{ack}
First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to Ricardo de Oliveira Schmidt for giving me the opportunity to work on this subject and providing support, feedback, and suggestions to improve my thesis. I sincerely thank to the other examination committee, Aiko Pras and Wouter de Vries. Additionally, I also would like to thank Jair, Luuk, and Wouter for being really helpful when I was working at the office. In particular for Jair, who greatly helped me preparing my presentation. 

I gratefully acknowledge the MCIT of Indonesia for funding my study, which allows me to make one of my dreams comes true. I am also grateful to all kind people who helped me throughout my master study at University of Twente whom I cannot mention one by one. May God reward you and accept your good deeds.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family for supporting me, and especially Pamahayu Prawesti for her patience and unconditional love.
